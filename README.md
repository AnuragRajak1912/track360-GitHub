Real-Time Monitoring of Construction Projects using Track360


Abstract:-

Track360 is a real-time monitoring platform designed to enhance transparency, efficiency, and control over construction projects. Utilizing cloud-based solutions and video conferencing through Zoom SDK, the platform provides a seamless experience for project managers and stakeholders. While future updates will introduce WebSocket for dynamic updates, the current iteration focuses on core functionalities, including video and image uploads, data visualization through Chart.js, and collaborative communication. This paper discusses the architecture, features, and anticipated advancements of the Track360 system, emphasizing its potential impact on the transportation and logistics sector.

1. Introduction

The construction industry is notorious for delays, budget overruns, and logistical challenges. Real-time monitoring systems like Track360 offer an innovative approach to addressing these issues. Track360 leverages modern technologies to provide project managers with a holistic view of project progress. The system's core capabilities include video conferencing via Zoom SDK and robust data visualization tools to track real-time updates in the transportation and logistics sector. Future iterations will incorporate WebSocket to further enhance the real-time experience.

2. System Overview

Track360 comprises several components designed to work together for efficient project monitoring:-

- Zoom SDK Integration:-   Zoom SDK serves as the primary tool for remote collaboration. Its reliability and high performance make it ideal for live video conferencing in construction projects, where frequent and seamless communication is critical. Unlike WebRTC, Zoom SDK provides a robust solution with minimal setup, allowing for immediate use during the current phase of development.

- Data Visualization:-     Chart.js has been integrated to visualize critical project metrics, such as budget tracking, timelines, and resource allocation. This ensures that stakeholders have access to real-time data presented in an understandable format.

- File Uploads:-   Users can upload images and videos, which are stored in the cloud for easy access by stakeholders. These visual data points are critical for tracking on-site progress, identifying bottlenecks, and ensuring project accountability.

3. Key Features

- Real-Time Monitoring:-     With the integration of Zoom SDK, Track360 allows for live updates and communication between on-site workers and off-site managers. This feature reduces the gap between field operations and office oversight.

- Data Insights via Chart.js:-   Data from construction sites, such as milestones and budget status, are presented visually. These insights empower decision-makers to take swift action on issues such as resource shortages or timeline adjustments.

- Secure File Management:-   Files uploaded to Track360 are securely stored and accessible to authorized personnel only. The system supports both video and image uploads to capture the progress of a construction site visually.

- Future WebSocket Integration:-     While not yet available, WebSocket will enable instant updates on construction metrics, providing a more dynamic user experience.

4. Architecture

The architecture of Track360 is modular, designed to accommodate future upgrades:-

- Frontend:-     Built using modern web technologies like EJS and BOOTSTRAP, the interface provides a seamless user experience. The integration of Chart.js ensures that users can access real-time data in visually engaging formats.

- Backend:-  Powered by Node.js and Express, the backend handles requests, manages user sessions, and connects to the MongoDB database. The project schema includes real-time data points such as employee roles, tasks, and deadlines.

- Database:-     MongoDB is employed for flexible, scalable data storage. Employee details, project metadata, and document uploads are stored here for quick retrieval and efficient management.

5. Future Work

Track360 is still under active development. The introduction of WebSocket will be a significant update, providing real-time push notifications and instant data synchronization across all devices. Additionally, future enhancements may include AI-driven predictions for project delays and automated report generation.

6. Conclusion

Track360 is poised to transform how construction projects are managed, especially in the transportation and logistics sectors. With its real-time monitoring capabilities, enhanced by video conferencing and data visualization, the platform offers a comprehensive solution to many of the industry's longstanding challenges. The upcoming WebSocket integration and other features will further enhance the user experience and ensure that Track360 remains at the forefront of construction project management tools.
